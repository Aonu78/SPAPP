# BlockWatch

To make it easier for you to understand the essence of the project, I will list the directories that currently exist.

- **/assets/css/style.css** - contains css of hame page and login and register forms

- **/assets/css/stocklist.css** - contains css of stock list page (i took it from the internet) so you can ignore it if you want and do it on your own way. You could try to use 

- **/assets/css/spapp.css** - contains spapp [this](https://github.com/amiletti/spapp) library to make it more interactive. You have also spapp.js in the **/assets/js/jQuery/spapp.js**
  
- **/assets/js/auth** - I tried to a jQuery auth logic there using validate.js and ajax. But it's not finished and doesn't work.

- **/assets/js/** - you can create your own single page application logic there how ever you want. But remember about SPAPP library.

- **/rest/** - completely ignore it - Backend of the app.

- **/tpl/** - contains html files of the app. All UI basicly will be made there with some addition of jQuery.

- **/index.html** - main file with all imports and includes of the app.

You are free to choose technologies from the list below to make it work:

SPApp
jQuery
Highcharts
Datatables
Select2
Bootstrap
Ajax
Forms and Validation
Block UI
